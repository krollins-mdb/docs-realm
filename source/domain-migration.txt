================
Domain Migration
================

The base URL that Atlas Device SDKs use will be updated from:
``https://realm.mongodb.com/`` to a new URL: 
``https://services.cloud.mongodb.com``.

Relevant SDK versions
---------------------

This change will affect all SDKs starting in the following versions:

- C++ SDK: version TBD
- Flutter SDK: version TBD
- Java SDK: version TBD
- Kotlin SDK: version TBD
- .NET SDK: version TBD
- Node.js SDK: version TBD
- React Native SDK: version TBD
- Swift SDK: version TBD

Begin Migration Now
-------------------

The new URL (``https://services.cloud.mongodb.com``) is available now and you
can begin using it by specifying a base URL in your app configuration. You should
also update your domain access lists to allow the new URL.

Refer to the SDK docs for details about specifying a base URL:

- :ref:`C++ SDK <cpp-connect-to-backend>`
- :ref:`Flutter SDK <>`
- :ref:`Java SDK <>`
- :ref:`Kotlin SDK <>`
- :ref:`.NET SDK <>`
- :ref:`Node.js SDK <>`
- :ref:`React Native SDK <>`
- :ref:`Swift SDK <>`

The old URL (``https://realm.mongodb.com/``) will continue to work, but will be
deprecated in the future. We recommend migrating to the new URL as soon as
possible.
